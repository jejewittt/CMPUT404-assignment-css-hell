
some changes - because i felt like it, i changed this image to a picture of dracula from hotel transelvania.
https://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-h/images/cover.jpg


I added a backround image that makes it look like old parchment. the source is in the style.css

note that i modified this file to make the colour beige instead of white.

I used pelican as a template to start my web resume, but then heavily modified it (and didnt use any template for the css)
